## How do I contribute to the project? ##

The easiest way to contribute to the project is to fork the github repo, work locally, then submit pull requests that (ideally) reference issues on the CJWizard issue tracker.

If you have non-source contributions (such as documentation, examples, etc..), or using github dosen't work for you for any reason, feel free to contact Rogan (creswick at gmail) and we will find a way to include your work.
